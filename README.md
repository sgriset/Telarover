Telarover is small robotic rover that is a customization of the actobitty (www.servocity.com/actobitty) rover.  It is designed to be visually piloted remotely by an operator. Telarover was going to intended to be my entry as a hackathon project while was working at AVAYA in 2015.  The idea of the project was a low cost telepresence device. Telarover was a simple two wheel drive four wheeled variant of actobitty using Simon Monks raspirobot version 1 has it motor controller.  The operator could use the arrow keys to steer based on a streaming video feed from the rover.  The main control program leveraged pygame and the video using motion.
